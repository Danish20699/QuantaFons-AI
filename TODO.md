# Hyperspeed Animation By the Numbers Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current Stats component has basic implementation with hyperspeed background
- Existing design follows IBM design system
- Four basic statistics with simple animations
- Road/highway speed effect using Three.js
- Good foundation but needs visual enhancement

## Plan: Enhanced Stats Section
1. **Update Statistics Content** - More impressive, industry-relevant numbers
2. **Enhanced Visual Design** - Improved typography, spacing, andD effects
3. **Optimized Hyperspeed Animation** - Better colors, intensity, and visual appeal
4. **Advanced Micro-interactions** - Better hover effects and transitions
5. **Improved Mobile Experience** - Better responsive design

## Files to Edit
- `client/src/components/home/Stats.tsx` - Main stats component
- `client/src/components/home/Hyperspeed.tsx` - Enhanced animation
- `client/src/index.css` - Additional animations and effects

## Follow-up Steps
1. Test the enhanced animation performance
2. Ensure mobile responsiveness
3. Verify IBM design compliance
4. Check animation performance on different devices
